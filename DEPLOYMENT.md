   - Verify redirect rules in `vercel.json` or `_redirects` file
   - Ensure history fallback is configured

3. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Ensure variables start with `REACT_APP_`
   - Check deployment platform's environment variable settings

### Getting Help

- Check deployment platform documentation
- Review build logs for specific error messages
- Test locally with `npm run build && npx serve -s build`

## Continuous Deployment

Both Vercel and Netlify support automatic deployments:
- Pushes to `main` branch trigger production deployments
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Configure branch protection and deployment rules as needed
